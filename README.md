“Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide.”

But what is it exactly? A specific type of cancer called lung cancer starts in the lungs, where it all 
starts when body cells decide to throw a crazy party and start growing out of control. Non-small cell 
lung cancer and small cell lung cancer are the two main subtypes of lung cancer. Smoking, exposure to second-hand smoke, 
exposure to specific chemicals, and a little amount of family history are frequently the causes of lung cancer. Let's not forget the suspects from the environment, 
such as radon, asbestos, and air pollution, which have their own discussions regarding their participation in this quaking play. So, to cut to the chase, 
I've chosen to analyze lung cancer data. I'll be diving into some exploratory data analysis (EDA) and unleashing a suitable machine learning algorithm on it.



About this dataset :
This dataset contains information on patients with lung cancer, including their age, gender, air pollution exposure, alcohol use, 
dust allergy, occupational hazards, genetic risk, chronic lung disease, balanced diet, obesity, smoking, passive smoker, chest pain, coughing of blood,
fatigue, weight loss ,shortness of breath ,wheezing ,swallowing difficulty ,clubbing of finger nails and snoring. Firstly kicking of with EDA:
